# Python version is 3.7, all fixed dependencies below have wheels

# Plotting
matplotlib==3.2.1
seaborn==0.10.0

# Indirect dependencies follow below:
# TODO Better descr
# One of seaborn's (0.9.0) deps was pandas>=0.15.2, and naturally it tries to pull
# the latest version (0.25.0) which doesn't have a wheel built for my python
# version (3.7, or cp37m). Pinning a version with a wheel compiled for your arch helps.
#
# TLDR: If you see pip trying to build a wheel locally (and a bunch of errors
# along the way b/c you don't have wheels and Cython packages to do that),
# look for the latest version with a wheel built for your python version here:
